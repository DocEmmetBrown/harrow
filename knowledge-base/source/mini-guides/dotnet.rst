Harrow and .NET
===============

.NET runs usually on Windows, which is not supported by Harrow but later versions of .NET work on Linux as well.
In those cases, it's possible to use Harrow for .NET framework  

If your project is among the ones that can be built on Linux, you can find information about the .NET cross-platform support in this article from TechCrunch: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/microsoft-takes-net-open-source-and-cross-platform/

Some setup guides are also available for the .NET Core  http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/  and for .NET Mono project http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/
