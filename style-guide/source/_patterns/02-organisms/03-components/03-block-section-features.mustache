        <h2>Complexity in DevOps is increasing</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Struggling with the number of tools your team use?</h3>
        <p>The increasing amount of tools and people plus the growing complexity in infrastructure lead to inefficiencies. For example a new team member has no idea how one is supposed to refresh the CDN caches. He does not know that a colleague wrote a script to update them. And even if he knew, would he be allowed to run it and have the correct CDN API keys at hand?</p>

        <h3>Whats the problem?</h3>
        <p>For the people who introduced the tools, they work beautifully. But not everyone else knows where to find them, and how to access or use them safely.</p>

        <h3>You think thats normal? Donâ€™t accept it.</h3>
        <p>Harrow is designed to reduce the complexity in your toolkit so that your team can focus on getting their work done.</p>
